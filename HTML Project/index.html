                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Chilli Paneer </h2>
                <p class="text-center">Frying The Paneer
                    Cut the paneer into bite size cubes and place in a wide bowl. Add 2 tablespoons plain flour, 2 tablespoons corn starch, 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder, 1/4 teaspoon pepper powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
                    Add around 3-4 tablespoons water and toss the flours to coat the paneer.
                    Heat oil for deep frying in a heavy pan.
                    Add the paneer cubes in batches to the hot oil depending on the size of your pan. Fry the paneer over medium heat.
                    Stir and spread the paneer while frying to avoid sticking at the bottom and also to each other.
                    Stir well and fry them until crispy and golden brown. This takes around 4-5 minutes over medium heat. Remove to a strainer and keep aside.
                    Preparing corn Flour slurry
                    Mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water and mix into a lump free paste. If you want to make the gravy version use 2 tablespoons cornstrach and 1 cup water. You could also use tapioca starch or potato starch.
                    Making Restaurant Style Chilli Paneer
                    heat 1 tbsp oil in a heavy wok or pan. Add chopped ginger garlic or paste, finely chopped green chillies, finely chopped celery, 1/2 tablespoon chili flakes. Saute for a minute in high flame.
                    Add the 1/2 cup cubed onions, 1/2 cup cubed capsicum. Cook for 2 minutes in highest flame. You can use either green bell pepper alone or mix of colored peppers. You could even use candy peppers to make it less spicier.
                    Next stir in the sauces- 1 tbsp green chilli sauce, 1 tbsp chilli paste or 1 teaspoon red chilli powder, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 1 tablespoon vinegar. Mix well and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. In restaurants they also add some tomato ketchup here.
                    Now add the cornstarch slurry and mix well. Add 1 cup water and mix. Let the chilli sauce cook for 2-3 minutes until it thickens well. For this dry version you need the sauce to be quite thick and sticky.
                    Once the chilli sauce is thick, add paneer cubes that we deep fried earlier and toss well with the spicy sauce. After adding fried paneer cubes to the prepared sauce do not cook for long.
                    Garnish chilli paneer with chopped spring onion greens and serve immediately.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Kadhai Paneer</h2>
                <p class="text-center">First of all, cube 2 large onions and measure out 1 cup cubed onions. Next chop 1 small onion finely. Chop the tomatoes very finely or puree them and measure out 2.5 cups. Chop 1 large green bell pepper or capsicum into cubes. Peel and mince the ginger garlic and set aside.
                Next if you are using store bought paneer, cube them and keep immersed in hot water until use. If you made paneer at home, just remove from the refrigerator, cubed and set aside. You will need around 1.5 cups cubed paneer for this recipe.
                To make masala powder, heat a small pan add the whole spices to it. Dry roast in low flame for 3-4 minutes.

Saute well for a minute until the raw smell of ginger garlic leaves and onions get cooked a bit. You can also use 1 teaspoon ginger garlic paste in this kadai paneer recipe.
                Now add the cubed onions and bell peppers. Saute in high heat for 2 minutes continuously. No need to do this in a separate pan and all.

                Add the ground masala powder, garam masala powder, Kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric powder and salt to taste.
                Mix well and cook till the tomatoes are completely cooked and fat releases from the sides. You can add 1/2 cup water at this stage. This is the base masala for kadai paneer.
                Add the cubed paneer pieces and mix gently. If you have made paneer at home just cube it an add. If using store bought paneer, cube and soak in hot water for 15 minutes, drain and add.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Malai Kofta</h2>
                <p class="text-center">
                    In this malai kofta recipe koftas are made of boiled potatoes and paneer. The gravy is made of tomatoes, onions and cashew paste.  Addition of malai or fresh cream makes this malai kofta recipe absolutely creamy and rich.
                    The koftas for malai kofta are made with boiled potatoes and paneer. You can leave out paneer and make just aloo koftas if you wish. The koftas are mildly spiced as we are adding it to the curry. These kofta are very tasty on their own. They are soft from inside and crispy at outside. You can serve these koftas as snack too.
                    You can easily prepare the gravy ahead and heat it up while serving. For koftas you can shape and refrigerate them. Just fry them before serving.
                    The main ingredient that gives richness to the gravy is cashew nuts. Cashews are soaked in warm water or milk for 30 minutes. Then ground to a smooth paste. This cashew paste adds richness and thickens the malai kofta gravy.
                    Malai kofta is a rich and heavy dish best enjoyed during special occasions. To make it light and a bit less on calories you can reduce the amount of malai or fresh cream added in the gravy
                    Shallow fry or pan fry the koftas instead of deep frying them
                    Add some corn flour slurry instead of cashew paste for thickening the gravy
                    Variations and Tips For Best Malai Kofta
                    For making koftas use potatoes that are less starchy that is use new potatoes.
                    Adding corn flour helps in retaining the crispness in kofta. Else they may turn soggy as soon as you add in the gravy. You can also add rice flour.
                    Fresh homemade paneer is best for making paneer kofta. if using store bought thaw it well in hot water for 15 minutes.
                    Instead of cashews you can use blanched almond puree while making gravy.
                    For vegan malai kofta use tofu in place of paneer and use non-dairy cream like cashew cream in gravy.
                    Finally you can adjust the spice powders as per taste. The recipe can be halved or doubled.

                    For the step by step pictures I have used only plain flour. I have used instant yeast or rapid raise yeast here. If using active dry yeast add it to 1/4 cup lukewarm water and mix well. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar on top, cover and set aside for 15 minutes to let the yeast activate. Add this yeast mixture to the flour and skip sugar in dough.

                    Making Dough
                    Combine 2.5 cups all purpose flour, yeast, sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl. Use a measuring cup or kitchen scale for precise measurements.
                    
                    plain flour, yeast, salt and sugar in a mixing bowl 
                    Mix well and add oil. Mix again well. You can add any cooking oil or even light olive oil.
                    
                    oil added to flour mixture 
                    Now add 3/4 teaspoon finely minced peeled garlic. Add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup warm water gradually and knead into soft and supple dough. The dough will be initially sticky, do not add too much more flour. Place the dough in a lightly oi Cover with a tea towel or plastic wrap.
                    
                    You can knead the dough in a food processor, stand mixer fitted with dough hook or even a bread machine selecting dough cycle for making homemade naan.
                    
                    freshly kneaded naan dough 
                    Let the dough rest at room temperature until it doubles in volume. Takes from 60-90 minutes. The dough should be soft and fluffy
                    
                    naan bread dough leavened with yeast 
                    Once the dough has raised, punch it back gently and knead again for a minute. Make sure the dough is soft fluffy and light.
                    
                    Shaping & Cooking Garlic Naan
                    Once the dough has raised, punch it back gently and knead the dough lightly again for a minute. Make sure the dough is soft fluffy and light.
                    
                    Divide the dough into 8 big lemon sized balls. Place a dough ball on a lightly floured surface.
                    
                    Rolling out portions of leavened dough
                    Roll into a oval flat bread of around 1/3 inch thickness using a rolling pin. The dough will be similar to pizza dough, you can simply stretch the dough ball with hand from all sides and make an oval.
                    
                    How to cook naan bread
                    While you are rolling the dough, heat a cast iron skillet or pan for 3-4 minutes. Maintain high flame. You will need a skillet with handle.
                    
                    After rolling the dough apply water with a pastry brush generously on one side. Add minced garlic as required. I have also added some coriander leaves and sunflower seeds. Press gently.
                    
                    Toppings added to rolled and shaped dough 
                    Now place the watered side down on the hot cast iron skillet. Cook for 30-40 seconds on hot skillet over medium high heat.
                    
                    water applied to one side of dough 
                    Now to cook the other side, place a grill stand like this over flame.
                    
                    stovetop grill stand heated 
                    Gently remove the naan from the and place on the grill stand, uncooked side facing flame. Cook until it puffs and chars, takes around 30-4o seconds.
                    
                    naan bread 
                    Place the cooked naan on a plate and brush with melted garlic butter or plain salted butter
                    
                    naan bread
                    If you don’t have grill stand you can just cook the flatbread on the pan or tava itself.  Just cook from both sides until it chars and puffs up a bit.
                    
                    easy naan bread
                    Serve soft fluffy chewy vegan naan bread warm.

                    To make this paneer sandwich first we should prepare scrambled paneer filling. I have used a mix of bell peppers along with crumbled paneer.

                    The filling is spiced with some green chilies and sesaoned with a dash of garam masala powder. You can increase the green chilies and seasoning for spicier sandwich. You can also leave out green chilies and use pepper powder instead.
                    
                    When making for toddlers and kids you can use a good dose of butter and grill the sandwich until crispy.
                    
                    For a low fat version reduce the butter or use olive oil.
                    
                    You can also toast the sandwich in a tava on stove top or use stove top grill pan instead of sandwich maker.
                    
                    Finally for vegan version use scrambled tofu and use oil instead of butter.
                    
                    Serve paneer sandwich as breakfast or snack with juice, tea or milkshake. This sandwich can also be packed in tiffin, lunchbox.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Paneer Tikka</h2>
                <p class="text-center">
                    Marinating Paneer:
                    This is first step in this recipe. You marinate the soft paneer cubes in a mix of thick curd and spice powders.
                    
                    This marination is what that gives excellent taste and flavor to paneer tikka. The marination procedure is standard and remains the same for most of the tikka recipes.
                    
                    Of course there will be some variations like hariyali tikka, achari tikka but mostly the marination is standard.
                    
                    The marinade for paneer tikka is a spicy and flavorful one made with a special spice blend called tandoori masala powder.
                    
                    But I never use that masala powder in my recipes. Just a couple of good old Indian spice powders are enough for this marinade.
                    
                    Let the paneer cubes marinate for 2-3 hours for a deep favored tikka.
                    
                    Skewer the paneer cubes:
                    Next step is to skewer the marinated paneer cubes along with veggies.  I prefer to use bamboo skewers for this.
                    
                    Skewer the paneer cubes and also cubed peppers and onions. I prefer to marinate the veggies also.
                    
                    Grill The skewers:
                    Now this step is for those who have an oven at home.
                    
                    Preheat your oven at the maximum temperature available for 15 minutes.
                    
                    Place the skewers on a foiled baking sheet and grill for 10 minutes.
                    
                    Slightly turn the skewers and grill for another 6-7 minutes.
                    
                    If you have broil option you can broil for last 2 minutes too.
                    
                    Let the tikka cool for sometime and then serve.</p>

                    further, add 1 more cup of milk and continue to stir continuously.
                    mix continuously, until the sauce thickens. if required using a whisk break the lumps.

                    Traditionally a wooden hand churner known as mathu (Tamil) or mathani (Hindi) is used to churn the yogurt. You will find this in all Indian homes. We use it to churn buttermilk to obtain butter. If you don’t have wooden churner you can easily use hand blender or mixer grinder. You can also add some ice cubes while churning but it will dilute the drink. If you use chilled yogurt, then ice cubes are not necessary.

                    Serve lassi in tall copper tumbler or earthen pot for best taste and flavor 🙂 Always serve as soon as you make it.</p>

                <p class="text-center">
                    Traditionally gulab jamun is made with khoya or mawa or evaporated milk solids. Khoya or mawa is a very prominent ingredient used in Indian cooking. It is obtained by simmering whole milk for hours and collecting the milk solids.

                    Khoya is used in many recipes, mostly in curries and sweets. Along with khoya gulab jamun, peda, burfi, ladoo, mawa cake and few halwa recipes use mawa.
                    
                    You can make this sweet with khoya if you can make it at home or get it easily from stores. Khoya is available in Indian grocery stores or some sweet shops sell them too. Look for it in frozen foods section or dairy section. You will need unsweetened khoya for this recipe. My secret ingredient for softest jamuns using khoya is cream or malai. Just adding 1/2 tablespoon of it lends wonderfully soft and melt in mouth jamuns, try it!
                    
                    Try to get soft khoya also known as chikna khoya which is easy to mash and knead.</p>

                    roasting cashews  
                    Transfer to a grinder jar and spice grinder and grind to a fine powder. Grind at small intervals. Refer to the tips above. This is the cashew powder for kaju barfi. You can also use a food processor.
                    
                    cashew powder for kaju katli 
                    Making Sugar Syrup For Kaju Katli Recipe
                    Measure 1/2 cup sugar first of all. Add sugar and 1/4 cup water in a heavy pan. You can use a non stick pan if you prefer.
                    
                    making sugar syrup 
                    Mix gently and cook in medium heat until sugar melts.
                    
                    sugar syrup for kaju katli 
                    Let the sugar dissolve completely. Add cardamom powder and few saffron strands. Adding flavorings is totally optional.
                    
                    Syrup boiling rapidly 
                    Once the sugar completely dissolves the mixture will start to boil. First bring to a rolling boil.
                    
                    Sticky sugar syrup for kaju katli 
                    Once the syrup starts to boil vigorously, it is the correct stage. No need to check for sugar syrup consistency.
                    
                    Making Kaju Barfi
                    Once the sugar syrup boils vigorously, quickly add the prepared powdered cashew. This is your cashew sugar mixture.
                    
                    mixing cashew powder with syrup 
                    Mix well thoroughly. Start cooking the cashew mixture in low flame.
                    
                    Kaju katli mixture coming together 
                    After 3-4 minutes the kaju barfi mixture will begin to thicken.
                    
                    cooking kaju mixture for making katli 
                    And after 6-7 minutes the whole cashew paste mixture will come together as a soft mass and begin to leave the sides of the pan. Remove from flame when the kaju mixture leaves the sides of the pan but let the mixture cook in the residual heat for another minute in the same minute. You need a very smooth paste.
                    
                    Thick smooth cashew mixture ready to make katli after cooking for 10 minutes.
                    To check if the kaju katli mixture is in right consistency to make katlis here is what you do. Take a small pinch of cashew paste and roll between your fingers. If you are able to form a soft ball that is non sticky and dry then the mixture is in the correct stage.
                    
                    If the mixture is sticky and you are unable to form balls, switch on the flame and cook the mixture for another 2 minutes in low flame.
                    
                    checking the consistency of kaju mixture by making small balls 
                    Now remove the whole mixture to a butter paper or parchment paper. You can also use a greased plate. Scrape the edges and add them as well. We will knead this kaju katli dough and make everything very smooth. If the paste is too sticky for you to handle you can add few drops of ghee (not vegan) or coconut oil (vegan). I have not used coconut oil or ghee here. On kneading cashews will release oil which will help you knead.
                    
                    cooked cashew mixture ready to be kneaded.
                    Add few saffron strands and start kneading the kaju barfi mixture. If using coconut oil or ghee apply in your palms now. Knead for 3-5 minutes into a very smooth soft dough. This step is crucial for melt in mouth kaju katli.
                    
                    Smooth cashew dough
                    After kneading roll the cashew dough into a 1/4 inch thick circle using a rolling pin. You can now gently press an edible silver leaf if you like.
                    
                    cashew dough rolled into a thin circle using rolling pin.
                    Slice into square or diamond shapes using a sharp knife or pizza cutter.
                    
                    Cashew mixture cut into diamonds
                    Let cool completely. Store in airtight containers and serve kaju katli as required.
                    
                    
                    Store kaju katli in airtight container. You can refrigerate if you prefer.

                <p class="text-center">
                    Since this is long process and takes quite some time, I take two days to make this Indian dessert. I usually prepare the rasgulla a day before and make ras malai next day.

                    Making chenna or milk solids – Preparation For Rasmalai
                    Heat milk in a pan. Bring the whole milk to a boil in a wide pan.
                    
                    Boiling milk in a pan 
                    As it starts to boil, lower the flame and add lemon juice. mix well and keep stirring until the milk curdles completely. Once the milk curdles completely and all whey is separated, remove from flame.
                    
                    Curdling milk with lemon juice 
                    Next to separate all the whey from chenna, line a colander with two layers of cheesecloth or cotton cloth. Pour the curdled milk into the prepared colander. Set aside for 5 minutes.
                    
                    separating chenna from curdled milk 
                    Now bring the edges of the cloth together rinse under cold water several times. This step will remove any sour taste from lemon juice.
                    
                    Now hang this over a hook or tap as seen in the photo for around 30-45 minutes.
                    
                    Hanging the curdled milk to remove whey 
                    once all the whey is drained collect the milk solid from the cloth.
                    
                    chenna or milk solid collected in a plate after separating whey water 
                    step 2- Shaping chenna balls and boiling in sugar syrup
                    Now we will knead the prepared chenna and make it soft and smooth.
                    
                    Take the chenna mass in a wide plate and start kneading. Knead for around 5-6 minutes by stretching and bringing it back. Knead until it starts to release a bit of fat. but do not over knead as it will result in chewy rasmalai balls.
                    
                    Chenna kneaded until smooth and soft to make rasgulla 
                    Now make around 20 small balls from the kneaded chenna and set aside.
                    
                    chenna or rasgulla balls ready to be cooked. 
                    In the meanwhile combine 1 3/4 cup sugar and 4 cups water in a big pan.
                    
                    sugar syrup for making rasgulla or rasmalai 
                    Cook until the sugar is completely dissolved and the syrup starts to boil. At this stage add 1 tsp cardamom powder and rose water. Mix well. Now slide the prepared rasmalai balls to the boiling sugar syrup and cover the pan.
                    
                    Boiling chenna balls in sugar syrup 
                    Cook for around 12-14 minutes or until the chenna balls soak up sugar syrup and doubles in size.
